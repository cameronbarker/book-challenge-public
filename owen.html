<td>On their mission to find only the most exotic ingredients for top-notch dishes, Rutabaga and his pet cooking pot, Pot, somehow manage to get themselves into a series of pickles. Amid the giant killer spiders, a desperate acting troupe, a nefarious thief, and a horde of toxic gubblins (nasty, goblin-like creatures) who threaten to take over the kingdom of Evanore, how is Rutabaga supposed to find any time to cook? Filled with the first volume&#39;s same brand of humor and high jinks, this installment takes readers to new locations in the fantastical world Eric Colossal has created and showcases more out-of-this-world platters that &quot;Ru&quot; brings to life. As in the first book, in the back are three safe, easy-to-make recipes for all ages.</td>

Raina eventually returns to school, where she&#39;s dealing with the usual highs and lows: friends, not-friends, and classmates who think the school year is just one long gross-out session. It soon becomes clear that Raina&#39;s tummy trouble isn&#39;t going away... and it coincides with her worries about food, school, and changing friendships. What&#39;s going on? Raina Telgemeier once again brings us a thoughtful, charming, and funny true story about growing up and gathering the courage to face -- and conquer -- her fears.</td>

<td>Batman and Robin meet Rocky and Bullwinkle. Through a series of fun, adventure stories, Laser Moose, who can shoot lasers from him eyes and his sidekick, Rabbit Boy, endeavor to save the forrest from looming threats. Laser Moose is about two forest animals who want to be superheros: Laser Moose and his sidekick Rabbit Boy. In a series of three short stories, they encounter menacing aliens, have a run in with Aquabear, and try to help Mechasquirrel after he is programmed by their evil nemesis cyborgupine. Laser Moose is a moose that shoots lasers out of his eyes. Because he has been given this special superpower, he sees himself as the great defender of the forest against the forces of evil. Unfortunatley he&#39;s not a terribly effective superhero; he often misinterprets what&#39;s evil and what isn&#39;t, and his superpower is pretty dangerous. He talks about the forest like it&#39;s Gotham City, when in fact it&#39;s pretty crime-free. Rabbit Boy is just a regular rabbit with no superpowers. He respects Laser Moose and wants to be a superhero too. Rabbit Boy is fortunately a lot more competent and heroic than Laser Moose, so he&#39;s more likely to get them out of trouble. This dynamic duo serves up lots of laughter for kids.</td>

Then, they must launch a satellite into space before a gigantic maelstrom smashes them to bloody splinters. If it were easy, it wouldn’t be Fortnite. When 98% of the world’s population disappears in the blink of an eye, the isolated survivors, four teenagers named Cody, Sarah, Idris, and Kiki each cower in the ruins of their homeland, pounded by strange storms and hunted by ravenous monsters. One by one they discover a hopeful sign of life from afar, a Beacon, that calls on to them to keep moving in search of answers. In their pursuit of the source of this signal, they find each other and struggle to get past their differences. It won’t be safe or easy, but their survival, and that of humanity, relies on them learning to work together in search of answers. They are, after all, humanity’s last hope. Will they find a way to survive and start again in the aftermath of the deadly storm, or die trying?</td>

<td>Jack might be the only kid in the world who&#39;s dreading summer. But he&#39;s got a good reason: summer is when his single mom takes a second job and leaves him at home to watch his autistic kid sister, Maddy. It&#39;s a lot of responsibility, and it&#39;s boring, too, because Maddy doesn&#39;t talk. Ever. But then, one day at the flea market, Maddy does talk—to tell Jack to trade their mom&#39;s car for a box of mysterious seeds. It&#39;s the best mistake Jack has ever made. In Mighty Jack, what starts as a normal little garden out back behind the house quickly grows up into a wild, magical jungle with tiny onion babies running amok, huge, pink pumpkins that bite, and, on one moonlit night that changes everything...a dragon.</td>

Even the power of their magic plants may not be enough to get them back to earth alive. Alone and injured, Jack and Lilly must each face their own monsters--as well as giants who grind the bones of human children to feed their &quot;beast&quot; and a fearsome goblin king in the sewers down below. But when Jack finds himself in a tough spot, help comes from the most unlikely person: the goblin king! Ben Hatke, the #1 New York Times-bestselling author of Zita the Spacegirl, concludes his latest middle-grade fantasy-adventure graphic novel series, Mighty Jack, with the energetic finale to his retelling of Jack and the Beanstalk.</td>

<td>&quot;Pilu of the Woods is a heartwarming tale full of natural wonder, with wise and lovely messages about coping with grief, facing your feelings, and learning to forgive yourself.&quot; - KATIE O&#39;NEILL (Eisner Award-winning author of The Tea Dragon Society) For fans of Anya&#39;s Ghost and I Kill Giants comes PILU OF THE WOODS, a heartwarming and bittersweet story of friendship, loss, exploring complex emotions and finding your way home from debut creator Mai K. Nguyen. Willow loves the woods near her house. They’re calm and quiet, so different from her own turbulent emotions, which she keeps locked away. When her emotions get the better of her one day, she decides to run away into the woods. There, she meets Pilu, a lost tree spirit who can’t find her way back home—which turns out to be the magnolia grove Willow’s mom used to take her to. Willow offers to help Pilu, and the two quickly become friends. But the journey is long, and Pilu isn’t sure she’s ready to return home yet—which infuriates Willow, who’s determined to make up for her own mistakes by getting Pilu back safely. As a storm rages and Willow’s emotions bubble to the surface, they suddenly take on a physical form, putting both girls in danger… and forcing Willow to confront her inner feelings once and for all. BONUS CONTENT: This edition includes blank journal pages in the back to encourage readers to keep their own notes about nature and their feelings.</td>

<td>New from syndicated comic strip artist Mark Tatulli comes a full-color middle grade graphic novel that centers on Mark&#39;s own experience in the summer after seventh grade. As a middle schooler, Mark finds himself on the smaller side of the physical spectrum--being short AND skinny has really wreaked havoc on his confidence. So to end his bullying woes and get the girl--or at least the confidence to talk to the girl--he starts to explore bulking up by way of the miracle cures in the backs of his comics. But his obsession with beefing up is soon derailed by a new obsession: Star Wars, the hottest thing to hit the summer of 1977. As he explores his creative outlets as well as his cures to body image woes, Mark sets out to make his own stamp on the film that he loves. Mark Tatulli&#39;s graphic novel debut is a humorous and heartfelt take on body-image, finding a creative outlet, and spending a summer in the 70&#39;s.</td>

<td>Who’s afraid of the Big Bad Fox? No one, it seems. The fox dreams of being the terror of the barnyard. But no one is intimidated by him, least of all the hens—when he picks a fight with one, he always ends up on the losing end. Even the wolf, the most fearsome beast of the forest, can’t teach him how to be a proper predator. It looks like the fox will have to spend the rest of his life eating turnips. But then the wolf comes up with the perfect scheme. If the fox steals some eggs, he could hatch the chicks himself and raise them to be a plump, juicy chicken dinner. Unfortunately, this plan falls apart when three adorable chicks hatch and call the fox Mommy. Beautifully rendered in watercolor by Benjamin Renner, The Big Bad Fox is a hilarious and surprisingly tender parable about parenthood that&#39;s sure to be a hit with new parents (and their kids too).</td>
